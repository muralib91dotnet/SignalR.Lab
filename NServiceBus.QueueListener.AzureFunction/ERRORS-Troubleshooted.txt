System.Exception: 'Could not find metadata for 'System.Text.Json.JsonElement'.
Ensure the following:
1. 'System.Text.Json.JsonElement' is included in initial scanning. 
2. 'System.Text.Json.JsonElement' implements either 'IMessage', 'IEvent' or 'ICommand' or alternatively, if you don't want to implement an interface, you can use 'Unobtrusive Mode'.'
